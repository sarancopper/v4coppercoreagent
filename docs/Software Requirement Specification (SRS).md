# Software Requirement Specification (SRS) and Architecture Document

## 1. Introduction
### 1.1 Purpose
This document provides a detailed **Software Requirement Specification (SRS)** and **Architecture Design** for the AI-driven Software Engineering Agent Tool. The system integrates multiple intelligent sub-agents to analyze requirements, generate plans, create code, validate outputs, test solutions, and deploy software automatically.

### 1.2 Scope
This AI-powered system assists developers in software development by automating repetitive tasks, suggesting improvements, and managing the entire lifecycle of a software project.

### 1.3 Intended Audience
- Software Engineers
- AI/ML Developers
- Project Managers
- DevOps Teams

### 1.4 System Overview
The tool consists of interconnected agents handling different stages:
- **Analyze Agent** – Understands requirements, identifies ambiguities, and generates clarifications.
- **Plan Agent** – Breaks down requirements into actionable steps.
- **CodeGen Agent** – Generates code based on planned steps.
- **Validation Agent** – Checks code quality and correctness.
- **Test Agent** – Generates and runs tests.
- **Deploy Agent** – Handles deployment automation.

## 2. Functional Requirements

### 2.1 Core Features
| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Requirement Analysis | Extracts key details and missing information from user input. |
| Task Planning | Breaks requirements into step-by-step development tasks. |
| Code Generation | Produces functional and structured code. |
| Validation & Testing | Ensures correctness, security, and efficiency. |
| Deployment Automation | Deploys the final output to the required environment. |

### 2.2 User Stories
- **As a Developer,** I want the system to generate complete, functional code so that I can reduce development time.
- **As a Project Manager,** I need to track execution logs to monitor AI-generated outputs.
- **As a Tester,** I want automated testing to verify correctness before deployment.

### 2.3 Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: Fast response times for all AI-generated results.
- **Scalability**: Ability to handle multiple projects simultaneously.
- **Security**: Secure handling of user data and generated code.
- **Logging & Auditing**: Store execution details for tracking.

## 3. System Architecture

### 3.1 High-Level Architecture
The architecture follows a **modular agent-based structure** where each agent is responsible for a specific function.

#### **Architecture Overview:**
1. **Frontend** (React-based UI)
   - User interface for interactions.
   - Displays AI-generated responses and logs.
2. **Backend** (Python & LangChain)
   - Orchestrates multiple agents.
   - Handles business logic and execution.
3. **Database** (PostgreSQL)
   - Stores user data, project details, execution logs, and AI interactions.
4. **External APIs**
   - OpenAI API for AI-based responses.
   - Cloud storage for generated files.

### 3.3 Agent Interaction Flow
1. **User inputs requirement** → Analyze Agent processes input.
2. **Analyze Agent** → Extracts ambiguities and generates clarifications.
3. **Plan Agent** → Creates step-by-step execution plan.
4. **CodeGen Agent** → Generates code based on plan.
5. **Validation Agent** → Checks correctness and security.
6. **Test Agent** → Runs tests on generated code.
7. **Deploy Agent** → Deploys final output to the chosen platform.

### 3.4 Data Flow Diagram (DFD)
1. User submits project requirements.
2. Data stored in DB and processed by Analyze Agent.
3. Planning and execution handled by respective agents.
4. Execution logs and responses stored in DB.
5. UI displays results and interaction history.

## 4. Technology Stack
| Component | Technology |
|-----------|------------|
| Frontend  | React.js, Tailwind CSS |
| Backend   | Python, FastAPI, LangChain |
| Database  | PostgreSQL |
| AI Engine | OpenAI API (GPT-based models) |
| Deployment | Docker, Kubernetes |

## 5. Deployment Strategy
1. **Development Phase**
   - Local environment setup with Docker.
   - Uses PostgreSQL for storing execution details.

2. **Production Deployment**
   - Hosted on cloud servers.
   - Scalable architecture with Kubernetes.

## 6. Logging & Monitoring
- **Logging**: Uses `log_agent_execution` to track agent activities.
- **Monitoring**: Tracks API usage, errors, and agent performance.

## 7. Security Considerations
- **Data Protection**: Encryption for sensitive data.
- **Access Control**: Role-based authentication.
- **Error Handling**: Graceful failure handling with logging.

## 8. Conclusion
This document outlines the AI-driven **Software Engineering Agent Tool**, covering its functionalities, architecture, and deployment strategies. By leveraging **LangChain, OpenAI, and modular agent-based architecture**, the system provides an efficient, AI-powered development workflow.
